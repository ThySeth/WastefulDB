## WastefulDB Interface
(Only available in Github repo)

A newly developed form of interacting with your data stored via WastefulDB; A command-line interface which could be used for quick changes or personal usage without the hastle of typing a whole new set of code.

The interface file can be found within the "`wastefuldb`" folder likely located in your `node_modules` folder and is named "**WastefulDB Interface**"! (A shortcut to "wastefulbat" for design reasons.)

When launching the interface, you simple press a number listed in the options menu, press enter, and provide the information needed to execute an action!

### Interface Requirement(s):
- `npm i chalk` (this should already be installed in the package itself)
